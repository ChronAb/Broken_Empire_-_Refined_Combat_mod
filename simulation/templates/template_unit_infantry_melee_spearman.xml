    <History>The spear is one of the most basic of human weapons.  Fighting with a sharp point at the end of the pole doesnâ€™t require a lot of technology.  The spear allow fighters to distance themselves from their attackers.
    They were originally employed by individual warriors in a fighting style similar to the quarterstaff.  As time passed the spears got longer and were used in formations.
    Spearmen tended to be as heavily armored as possible, as carrying a long pole-arm already limits mobility.  Many used large shields such as the Greek hoplon.</History>
    <Tooltip>Highly effective for group-fighting vs cavalry and infantry.  Excellent defense vs slings and arrows.  Weak vs skirmishers and swordsmen.</Tooltip>
