Non binding authorial courtesy:
-----------------------------------
If anyone wants to try to (re)use any components my original source code in other mods or projects, then go for it.
I'd appreciate it if you try to give me a heads up just to inflate my ego, but you don't need my permission.

And! Do not ask my permission anyway, because then I will know you didn't read my licensing terms and I might decide to say no just to mess with you. 

If you want to credit me, just call me the author of the Broken Empire mod. I think insubstantiative attribution is a vain cultural affectation that ought to be expunged.
